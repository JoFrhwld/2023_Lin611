## R vs RStudio vs Quarto

![An illustration of R vs RStudio vs Quarto](assets/IMG_5054.png){fig-alt="A nodes and arrow diagram illustrating the relationship between R and RStudio and Quarto" fig-align="center" width="100%"}

R (on the left) is a programming language, which looks at (ðŸ‘€) R scipt files (the box with .r) and interprets them. RStudio is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that provides a more pleasant interface to working with R.

Quarto (not pictured) is a program that interprets Quarto documents (the box with .qmd) and renders them as html files. We\'ll be doing this all inside of RStudio.

## Examples from inside class

This was an example of inserting an R code chunk into a quarto notebook

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
1+1
```

This was an example of making a plot in quarto

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
plot(cars)
```

This was an example of running R code from Winters (2019). This particular code prints out all of the named colors in R.

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
colors()
```

This was just an illustration of using the color "steelblue" in a plot.

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
plot(cars, col = "steelblue")
```

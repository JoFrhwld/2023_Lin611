## The formula for a line

Cast your mind back to algebra days. You might remember the formula for a line being $y=mx + b$. We're going to be working with that basic concept, except moving around some of the variables and renaming them.

$$
y = \text{intercept} + (\text{slope}\times x)
$$

$$
y = b_0 + bx
$$

## Plan

-   Review lines and their geometry

-   Lines as models

-   Residuals

-   Sum of Squared Residuals

-   $r^2$
